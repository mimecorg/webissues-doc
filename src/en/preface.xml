    <title>About the book</title>

    <para>This book is intended for users and administrators of the WebIssues team collaboration system. It was written both for people who have never used any issue tracking software and team collaboration support systems, as well as those who already have experience with similar software.</para>

    <para>This guide was written by the creator of WebIssues, taking into account questions and comments raised by users over several years of development of this system. My goal was to create the most useful and helpful documentation. Therefore, unlike the previous version, this book focuses more on the most commonly performed tasks and not on describing the various windows and functions.</para>

    <para>Just as the entire WebIssues system, this book is licensed under a free license, which means that it can be freely modified and redistributed. I encourage you to send comments and suggestions for improvement.</para>

    </variablelist>

    <para>In the Desktop Client it is possible to administer users and projects and to manage issue types and views. The <guilabel>Users</guilabel> and <guilabel>Types</guilabel> commands are available directly from the main window's toolbar. However, the full Administration Panel is not available. In order to access the event log or change system settings, you must therefore use the Web Client.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="webissues.admin.info">
    <title>Server information</title>

    <para>In order to display general information about the server, go to the Administration Panel and click <guilabel>General Information</guilabel>.</para>

    </figure>

    <para>You will see the version number of the currently installed database schema, the name of the server and its unique identifier. You can use the <guilabel>Rename Server</guilabel> command to change the name of the server, which is visible in the upper left corner of the Web Client and in the title bar of both client programs. With the <guilabel>Generate New Unique ID</guilabel> command you can change the identifier of the server to a new, randomly generated identifier.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Note</title>
      <para>The unique identifier allows the Desktop Client to distinguish individual instances of the WebIssues server, regardless of their name and URL. It is automatically generated during the installation, and normally there is no need to change it. Changing this identifier may be needed when a server instance is cloned (for example, when an update is tested on a temporary copy before deploying to production environment), and also after manually making changes to the database (for example, when you restore a previous version of the database from the backup).</para>
    </note>

    <para>The next section displays the configuration of your server, including the status of anonymous access and user self-registration, the configuration of outgoing and incoming email servers, and the last execution of the cron job which is necessary for sending and receiving emails to work. For more information, see <xref linkend="webissues.prep.nofitications.cron"/>.</para>

    <para>In the next section you can see information about the type and version of the database server, the name of the host and the database, and an optional prefix for table names in the database. Below the configuration of the server's site is displayed, including the name of the instance (usually it will be <literal>default</literal>, unless you created multiple instances of the server within a single installation), the base URL of the server and the path of the directory where the configuration file is located. The last section displays the version of PHP, the web server and the operating system, and the name of the computer on which WebIssues is installed.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="webissues.admin.log">
    <title>Event log</title>

    <para>To view the event log of the WebIssues server, go to the Administration Panel and click <guilabel>Event Log</guilabel>.</para>

    <para>The event log contains information about errors, access to the system, important administrative operations and cron job executions. It is independent from the logs of PHP, the web server and the operating system. Its purpose is to supplement those information, not to replace them. In particular, some serious errors (such as lack of access to the database) cannot be stored in the event log of the WebIssues server.</para>

    <para>Events in the event log are divided into four types:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Errors</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Errors and warnings in the system WebIssues. They may result from incorrect input data, lack of permission to perform some operations, conflicts between parallel changes or incorrect system configuration.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Access</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Information about successful and failed attempts to log into the system, as well as errors associated with the denial of access to specific pages or operations.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Audit</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Information about important administrative operations, such as: creating and changing passwords or permissions of users, creating, deleting and modifying issue types, attributes, projects and folders, and deleting issues.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Cron</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Information about executions of the cron job. For more information, see <xref linkend="webissues.prep.nofitications.cron"/>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>Events also have three different levels of severity: information, warning and error. They are marked with different icons.</para>

    <para>By default, the log displays all events, sorted from newest to oldest. If you are interested only in a specific type of events, click on one of the options in the upper right corner of the window to enable filtering.</para>

    <para>Click on an event to view detailed information about it. In addition to the type, severity and full message, also the name of the user who performed the operation and the host name or IP address, from which the connection was made, are displayed.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Note</title>
      <para>Although detailed information about errors are stored in the event log, for security reasons they are not displayed on error pages. However, you can enable detailed error messages for development or troubleshooting purposes. You can also enable an additional text log which makes debugging easier. However, you should not enable those settings in production environment. For more information, please visit <ulink url="http://wiki.mimec.org/wiki/WebIssues/Configuration"/>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Events are automatically removed from the log after a specified amount of time. For more information about configuring this period, refer to <xref linkend="webissues.custom.settings"/>.</para>

  <sect1 id="webissues.admin.users">
    <title>Managing users</title>

    <para>Managing users in the WebIssues system includes the creation of user accounts, managing global rights of users, and giving users access to specific projects.</para>

    <sect2 id="webissues.admin.users.accounts">
      <title>User accounts</title>

      <para>To manage the users of WebIssues system, go to the Administration Panel and click <guilabel>User Accounts</guilabel>. In case of the Desktop Client, use the <guilabel>Users</guilabel> command from the main window toolbar.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>User accounts</title>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Each user has a unique, fixed login, which is used along with the password when logging into the system. Each user also has a name that is visible to other users and that can be changed by the administrator if necessary. Depending on the convention, it can be the first and last name, the email address, or any other name.</para>

      <para>To create a new user account, select <guilabel>Add User</guilabel>.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Creating a user account</title>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Enter the name of the user, the login and initial password. To avoid mistakes, you must enter the password twice. You can select <guilabel>User must change password at next logon</guilabel> to force the user to change password when logging into the system for the first time.</para>

      <para>If the user doesn't remember their password, you can reset it by selecting the user from the list and clicking <guilabel>Change Password</guilabel>. You will be asked to enter a new password twice. Also in this case you can select <guilabel>User must change password at next logon</guilabel>.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Changing user's password</title>
        <mediaobject>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>When you're changing your own password, for greater security you must also enter your current password. All users can also change their own password at any time, using the <guilabel>Change Password</guilabel> command, which is available in the <guilabel>Tools</guilabel> window or in the toolbar of the Desktop Client main window.</para>

      <note>
        <title>Note</title>
        <para>If you forget the system administrator's password, you cannot easily recover it. All passwords are stored in a database as secure hashes, and it's practically impossible to recreate the original password. However, if you have  access to the database, you can reset the administrator's password, by generating a new hash and storing it in the <literal>user_passwd</literal> column for the corresponding user in the <literal>users</literal> table. WebIssues uses the <quote>Portable PHP password hashing framework</quote>, which is compatible with such programs as WordPress or Drupal, so you can use one of the available <ulink url="http://scriptserver.mainframe8.com/wordpress_password_hasher.php">hash generators</ulink> for these programs.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To change the name of a user, select that user on the list and click <guilabel>Rename User</guilabel>. Enter a new name and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.</para>

      <tip>
        <title>Tip</title>
        <para>Avoid changing the names of users who have assigned issues. Attribute values ​​are stored as text, so changing the user name will not automatically change the values ​​of <quote>Assigned to</quote> attributes. This may cause the user to no longer see those assigned issues.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>A newly created user has no access to any project, unless he is the system administrator. To change the global access and manage the list of projects available for the selected user, use the <guilabel>Manage Permissions</guilabel> command. For more information see <xref linkend="webissues.admin.users.permissions"/> below.</para>

      <para>You can also change the preferences of any user using the <guilabel>User Preferences</guilabel> command. All users can also change their own settings, using the <guilabel>User Preferences</guilabel> command in the <guilabel>Tools</guilabel> window or in the toolbar of the Desktop Client main window. For more information about user preferences, see <xref linkend="webissues.work.personal"/>.</para>

      <para>The WebIssues system does not allow to delete existing users, because it keeps all the historical information; for example, changes made by individual users. Instead, you disable access for selected users when they should no longer be able to use the system. Use the filtering options in the upper right corner of the list to hide disabled user accounts.</para>

      <para>The WebIssues system allows users to register new accounts by themselves. For more information about configuring user self-registration, see <xref linkend="webissues.custom.access"/>.</para>

          <term>System administrator</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>System administrators have access to all functions of the Administration Panel. They can manage user accounts and customize the issue types and public views. They are also administrators of all existing projects in the system, even if they are not explicitly granted such permissions. The first such account is created upon installation.</para>

  <sect1 id="webissues.admin.register">
    <title>Registration requests</title>

    <para>The WebIssues system administrator can enable an option that allows users to register new accounts. A new user has to provide the name, login and password, and the email address, which is verified by sending an activation message. Unless automatic approval of registration requests is enabled, registration requests must be approved by the administrator. During the approval, the projects to which the new user has access must be specified. Only then the user will be able to log into the system.</para>

    <para>The approved registration request will disappear from the list, and a new user will appear in the list of user accounts, where you can change the name, permissions, settings and password, just like for accounts created directly by the administrator. The user will also receive an email notification that the request was approved.</para>

    <para>To reject the selected registration request, use the <guilabel>Reject Request</guilabel> command. The request will be removed from the list, and the user will receive an email notification that the request was rejected.</para>

            <para>Public projects are visible to all users in the system, including both system administrators and regular users. There is no need to explicitly grant access to individual members, except for project administrators. This is useful for projects containing common data, such as discussion boards, and also when it's not necessary to restrict user permissions for individual projects. Also, when anonymous access is enabled, the project can be accessed in read only mode without logging in to the system.</para>

      <para>You can also assign specific access for the project to individual users. There are two levels of access for project members:</para>

          <term>Project administrator</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Project administrators can manage permissions and folders of the project. They can also delete or move issues and edit and delete all comments and attachments within the project. Finally, they can manage public alerts and modify the project description.</para>

          <term>Regular member</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Regular members can view issues in all folders, manage their own alerts, and create new issues and edit existing ones. They can also add comments and attachments, and edit and delete their own comments and attachments.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>The global permissions of the user are always more important than permissions for a given project. A system administrator automatically becomes the administrator of all projects, and a disabled user has no access to any project. Regular users only have access to public projects and regular projects that they are members of, according to the permissions that were assigned to them.</para>

      <title>Archiving projects</title>

      <para>When a project is no longer needed, it is possible to remove it without permanently deleting it. When a project is archived, it is removed from the projects tree and no one can access any folders and issues in that project. However, unlike deleted projects, archived projects can be restored at any time. Only system administrators can archive and restore projects.</para>

      <para>To archive a project, go to <guilabel>Manage Projects</guilabel> from the main window, select the project, and then click <guilabel>Archive Project</guilabel>. In case of the Desktop Client, this command is available directly from the main window if you activate the projects tree.</para>

      <tip>
        <title>Tip</title>
        <para>It is not possible to archive individual folders, but you can create a new project, move the folder or folders that you want to archive to that project, and then archive the project.</para>

      <para>To open a list of archived projects, go to the Administration Panel and click <guilabel>Projects Archive</guilabel>. This function is not available in the Desktop Client.</para>

      <para>To restore an archived project, select the project and click <guilabel>Restore Project</guilabel>. The project will be removed from the list of archived projects and will appear in the projects tree. The folders, issues, permissions, alerts and other information related to the project will be preserved.</para>

      <para>To permanently delete an archived project, select the project and click <guilabel>Delete Project</guilabel>. In that case it will no longer be possible to restore any information associated with the project. You can also use the <guilabel>Rename Project</guilabel> command to rename an archived project and the <guilabel>View Description</guilabel> command to view the description of the project, if available. Note that it is not possible to access any folders and issues or to modify the project while it's archived.</para>

    <title>Updating the system</title>

    <para>One of the maintenance tasks is updating the WebIssues system to a newer version. New versions fix potential problems and add new features, so it is recommended to periodically update the software. To quickly check if a newer version of the system is available, click <guilabel>Tools</guilabel> and <guilabel>About WebIssues</guilabel>, and then in the <guilabel>Latest Version</guilabel> group, click the <guibutton>Check</guibutton> button. The Desktop Client by default automatically checks if a new version is available (see <xref linkend="webissues.work.personal.client"/>).</para>

    <para>Before the update, it is recommended to back up the database and WebIssues system files, and also disable the web server to prevent other users from accessing the system during the update.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Note</title>
      <para>If you cannot disable the server or block access to it, you can also temporarily rename the <literal>config.inc.php</literal> configuration file, which by default is located in the <literal>data/sites/default</literal> subdirectory. You may even completely remove the file, and then recreate it using the installer, because at the time of installation the existing database will be preserved and automatically updated to the new version.</para>
    </note>

    <para>First, delete all files and subdirectories from the directory where you installed the WebIssues server, remembering to keep the <literal>data</literal> subdirectory, which stores all files related to the particular installation; for example, configuration files and attachments of issues. If you created your own <literal>.htaccess</literal> file or <literal>web.config</literal> file (in case of IIS), then also make a copy of it to be able to restore it later.</para>

    <para>Download and unpack the new WebIssues server package &mdash; it contains a directory named <literal>webissues-x.y</literal> (where <literal>x.y</literal> is the version of the package). Then move all files and subdirectories from that directory to the directory where the WebIssues server was previously installed.</para>

    <para>After copying the files, enable the web server and open the main page of the WebIssues system in the browser. If there is a need to update the database, a message will be displayed. You will be asked to enter the login and password of the WebIssues system administrator, and then the database will be updated to the current version. Otherwise, the system is immediately ready to work.</para>

    <para>It is also recommended to update the Desktop Client to a newer version on the computers of all people who use it. Generally, however, the Desktop Client can communicate with both older and newer version of the server, provided that the first two digits of the version number is the same. Therefore, client version 1.0 will not work with the 1.1 system, and client version 1.1 will not work with the 1.0 system, but both versions can be installed side by side on a single computer.</para>

    <note>
      <title>Note</title>
      <para>Versions marked as <literal>beta</literal> are the so-called developer versions. They allow for testing new features before the official version is released, but it is not recommended to use them for production purposes. Development versions of the system can only be used with the same version of the Desktop Client. It is possible to update from a production version to a newer development version (for example, from 1.0.5 to 1.1-beta1), and from the production version to the final production version (for example, from 1.1-beta1 to 1.1).</para>
    </note>

    <para>When updating the server from version 1.0 to version 1.1, the first comment of each issue will be automatically converted to its description, but only if it was created by the person who created the issue and no more than 15 minutes after creating it. You may review the issues after the update and change the descriptions if necessary. Note that all comments and descriptions updated from version 1.0 will use the plain text format, but you can change the format when editing them.</para>

    <para>In order to update the server from version 0.8.5, you must first install version 1.0 of the server and select the option to import existing data from version 0.8.5. Then you can update the server from version 1.0 to 1.1.</para>
